pynmsg
======

This is `pynmsg`, a Python extension module implemented in
[Cython](http://cython.org/) for the [nmsg](https://github.com/farsightsec/nmsg)
C library.

Building
--------

Building from a git checkout requires a C compiler, Python, Cython, and the
`nmsg` library to be installed first. Distribution tarballs ship with a copy of
the Cython-generated code and do not require Cython to actually be installed.

`pynmsg` is built by running `setup.py`:

    python setup.py build


Python Performance
------------------
Some notes on performance. In particular, Python isn't great at receiving nmsgs
off of the network at high rates, and processing them reliably.

Reading from a socket suffers about 75% loss (our test sent 1723300 messages, pynmsg recvd ~400k),
so although the ability to read from the network exists, but transport is UDP, this
Python library is not appropriate for receiving a high volume container stream.

C Performance
-------------

As a point of comparison, running the same test: using nmsgtool to read from a file,
write to a localhost socket but instead of Python, using another nmsgtool reading
from the localhost socket:

writer sends: 1723300 messages

reader reads:

| run# |   read  | loss|
|-----|---------|-----|
|1   |  1717510  | <1%|
|2   |  1710776  | <1%|
|3   |  1709553  | <1%|
|4   |  1666319  |~3%|
